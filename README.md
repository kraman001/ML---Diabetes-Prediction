## Dataset

The dataset used is the **PIMA Diabetes Dataset**, which contains health records of 768 individuals. Each record includes various health metrics such as glucose level, BMI, insulin level, and more. The target variable is `Outcome` which indicates if the person is diabetic (`1`) or non-diabetic (`0`).

## Features

The dataset consists of the following features:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times the person has been pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: Age of the person in years.
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic).

## Model

The model uses the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm for classification. The following steps are performed:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Scaling of features using `StandardScaler` to ensure that all variables are on the same scale.
2. **Model Training**: The SVM model is trained on 80% of the data.
3. **Model Testing**: The model's performance is evaluated on the remaining 20% of the data.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library.

## Usage

To use the model for prediction:
1. Run the notebook or Python script to load the dataset and train the model.
2. Modify the input parameters in the script or notebook to predict whether a person is diabetic.

Example usage in the notebook:
```python
# Example input data
input_data = [5, 166, 72, 19, 175, 25.8, 0.587, 51]

# Reshaping the input for a single prediction
input_data_reshaped = np.array(input_data).reshape(1, -1)

# Making a prediction using the trained model
prediction = model.predict(input_data_reshaped)

if prediction[0] == 0:
    print("The person is non-diabetic.")
else:
    print("The person is diabetic.")
```

## Results

The accuracy of the model is evaluated using the accuracy score on both training and test datasets. Below are the performance metrics:
- **Training Accuracy**: `X%` (78.66%)
- **Test Accuracy**: `Y%` (77.27%)

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements to increase model accuracy and generalizability include:

- **Testing Additional Algorithms**: Exploring other classification models, such as Decision Trees or Random Forests.
- **Feature Engineering**: Adding or transforming features to enhance model insights.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusting parameters of the SVM model for optimized performance.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combining multiple models to enhance predictive power.

### Key Highlights of the Project:
This Project implements a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on patient data from the PIMA Diabetes Dataset. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key components:

### Data Collection:

- The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
- The data consists of features such as Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age, with the target variable being Outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic).

### Data Preprocessing:
-  ``StandardScaler`` is used to scale the input features, ensuring that all features are on a similar scale for better performance of the model.
-  The data is split into features (X) and the target label (Y).

### Model Building:
- The **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm is used to train the model.
- The dataset is split into training and test sets using ``train_test_split``.

### Model Evaluation:
- The performance of the model is evaluated using the  **accuracy** score on both the training and testing data.
- The accuracy of training data is **78%** and for test data is **77%**.
